        <h1>Hosting 1/2</h1>
        <p><b>High performance at your fingertips</b><br><br>ARONE offers its customers high-performance virtual server hosting services and plenty of disk space. All of ARONE's applications are hosted on virtual servers for optimal availability and faster
          deployment.<br><br>A real-time monitoring system provides proactive processing of errors and technical and environmental anomalies (temperature, humidity, flooding, etc.).<br></p>
        <p><br><b>Hosting eCRF and IWRS applications</b><br><br>ARONE hosts and manages practically all the eCRFs and IWRS it develops for its customers. Although this is by no means mandatory, our customers often opt for this possibility as it means they
          no longer have the headaches of maintaining server hardware and availability.<br></p>
        <p><br><b>Backup and DRP</b><br><br>Backing up our servers and our hosted data is an absolute priority. Each server is backed up regularly by different methods (data export, backup files, snapshots of virtual servers) onto different systems (tape,
          SAN, external server).<br><br>Our DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan) covers all possible risks and means that operations are resumed with very little down time and no data loss.<br></p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h1>Hosting 2/2</h1>
        <p><br><b>Application hosting</b><br><br>ARONE also hosts customer applications that require special management. For instance, as a direct result of the wealth of its experience with the pharmaceutical industry, ARONE has set up a quality system
          that guarantees data security in compliance with regulatory obligations and logs all events in the hosted application's lifecycle.<br></p>
        <p><br><b>The advantages of virtualization</b><br><br>Server virtualization guarantees high application availability thanks to faster server deployment and above all faster redeployment.<br><br>Virtualization has no negative effects on performance;
          it means that applications are arranged logically either by environment or by customer.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <h1>Training</h1>
        <p><br><b>Tailor-made training</b><br><br>ARONE provides user training in the applications it develops and installs, and particularly its eCRFs and IWRS solutions. We can take part in investigator meetings, train project staff who can then roll out
          the training in the different centers, or we can ourselves provide direct training in investigating centers. We can also take advantage of these sessions to give attendees a brief reminder of Good Clinical Practice.<br></p>
        <p><br><b>Online training</b><br><br>Each of our solutions comes with its own e-Learning module. Sponsor or center personnel who have completed this online training will have no difficulty working in the various applications.<br></p>
        <p><br><b>User's Guide</b><br><br>ARONE prepares a customized user's guide for each clinical trial, explaining system functions and study specificities.</p>

      <div class="item">
        <h1>Validation</h1>
        <p><br><b>Controlling the development cycle</b><br><br>ARONE believes in validation, and devotes a great deal of effort to validating each and every project and study. This validation means that the development cycle is fully controlled from initial
          software design to it entering production. Likewise for each study, the aim is to exert end-to-end control right through from the initial requirements (which include the CRF, validation controls, management rules, etc.) to project production
          and follow-up (system maintenance). This validation, in addition to a number of tests, also includes customer involvement at several steps to ensure that the system's design perfectly matches your requirements.<br><br>ARONE has adopted GAMP
          5 methodology and complies with the steps it involves.<br></p>
        <p><br><b>Regulatory compliance</b><br><br>Software validation is a regulatory requirement. It provides proof that sufficient resources have been deployed to guarantee validated system reliability and the security of the data generated.<br><br>The
          many documents generated by the validation may be:<br>• consulted or audited by our customers,<br>• delivered to our customers,<br>• stored by ARONE throughout project lifecycle.</p>

        <p><br><b>Quality = Customer satisfaction</b><br><br>Our commitment to developing and delivering high-quality products has culminated in today's Projection® application suite that is recognized by customers and end users for its reliability and powerful
          capabilities.</p>

          have access to a broad range of tools to resolve any problems immediately. If the technician is unable to find a solution, a second-level team will analyze and resolve the problem.<br><br>Problems are logged in a database that over time is gradually
          constituting a knowledge base.<br></p>
        <p><br><b>Real-time system monitoring</b><br><br>ARONE has set up a system in all its applications and servers that automatically reports any problems.<br>• an email is sent automatically if a bug occurs,<br>• an email is sent automatically if a
          server goes down,<br>• ...</p>

        <p><b>Generating randomization lists</b><br><br>"ARONE can generate the randomization lists you need for your studies."<br><br>You set the parameters (number of subjects, number of treatment arms, size of treatment blocks, etc.), we generate the
          corresponding randomization list.<br><br>This list is either generated in accordance with our own "Randomization SOP-OP07" procedure or with our customer's procedure.<br></p>
        <p><br><b>Process</b><br><br>• Parameters entered into the system we use to generate randomization lists, or a specific program is written to generate the list,<br>• A test list is generated,<br>• This test list is sent to the customer for verification
          and validation.<br>• The final randomization list is generated,<br>• The list is quality controlled,<br>• The final list in a sealed envelope is sent to the customer who acknowledges receipt.<br>• The list is sent to the packer (if any).</p>
