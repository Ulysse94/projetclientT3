        <h1>Hosting</h1>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>High performance at your fingertips</h3>
            <p>ARONE offers its customers high-performance virtual server hosting services and plenty of disk space. All of ARONE's applications are hosted on virtual servers for optimal availability and faster
              deployment.<br><br>A real-time monitoring system provides proactive processing of errors and technical and environmental anomalies (temperature, humidity, flooding, etc.).<br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
        <h3>Hosting eCRF and IWRS applications</h3>
          <p>ARONE hosts and manages practically all the eCRFs and IWRS it develops for its customers. Although this is by no means mandatory, our customers often opt for this possibility as it means they
            no longer have the headaches of maintaining server hardware and availability.<br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
        <h3>Backup and DRP</h3>
          <p>Backing up our servers and our hosted data is an absolute priority. Each server is backed up regularly by different methods (data export, backup files, snapshots of virtual servers) onto different systems (tape,
            SAN, external server).<br><br>Our DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan) covers all possible risks and means that operations are resumed with very little down time and no data loss.<br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
        <h3>Application hosting</h3>
          <p>ARONE also hosts customer applications that require special management. For instance, as a direct result of the wealth of its experience with the pharmaceutical industry, ARONE has set up a quality system
            that guarantees data security in compliance with regulatory obligations and logs all events in the hosted application's lifecycle.<br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>The advantages of virtualization</h3>
          <p>Server virtualization guarantees high application availability thanks to faster server deployment and above all faster redeployment.<br><br>Virtualization has no negative effects on performance;
            it means that applications are arranged logically either by environment or by customer.</p>

        <h1>Training</h1>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>Tailor-made training</h3>
          <p>ARONE provides user training in the applications it develops and installs, and particularly its eCRFs and IWRS solutions. We can take part in investigator meetings, train project staff who can then roll out
            the training in the different centers, or we can ourselves provide direct training in investigating centers. We can also take advantage of these sessions to give attendees a brief reminder of Good Clinical Practice.<br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>Online training</h3>
          <p>Each of our solutions comes with its own e-Learning module. Sponsor or center personnel who have completed this online training will have no difficulty working in the various applications.<br></p>

        <div class="para">
          <h3>Controlling the development cycle</h3>
          <p>ARONE believes in validation, and devotes a great deal of effort to validating each and every project and study. This validation means that the development cycle is fully controlled from initial
            software design to it entering production. Likewise for each study, the aim is to exert end-to-end control right through from the initial requirements (which include the CRF, validation controls, management rules, etc.) to project production
            and follow-up (system maintenance). This validation, in addition to a number of tests, also includes customer involvement at several steps to ensure that the system's design perfectly matches your requirements.<br><br>ARONE has adopted GAMP
            5 methodology and complies with the steps it involves.<br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">

          <p>Software validation is a regulatory requirement. It provides proof that sufficient resources have been deployed to guarantee validated system reliability and the security of the data generated.<br><br>The
